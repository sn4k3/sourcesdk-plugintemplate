        Functions FormatIface, InterfaceSearch, VInterfaceMatch copied to serverplugin_engine for best compalibity with VSP plugins.<br>

        Many people never know what nemod is, but all i can say it was good as Mani is now ;)<br>

        Eventscripts scripts are now python based, so optional you can compile your plugin with python support.<br>
        And make your plugin ES friendly<br>
        Compile with python feature is dedicated to Eventscripts.<br>
        Thanks for the great EventScripts and what I learned there

	The idea of redirect serverplugin_engine.cpp callbacks for serverplugin_main.cpp to ensure max compability and better updates came from him
	
 Metamod:Source Team
	http://sourcemm.net
	For the metamod interface and SourceHook.
	Functions FormatIface, InterfaceSearch, VInterfaceMatch copied to serverplugin_engine for best compalibity with VSP plugins.
	The plugin samples helpme implement the new metamod source

 nemod
	Google it!
	Many people never know what nemod is, but all i can say it was good as Mani is now ;)
	Timers idea came from nemod
	In old sources i used nemod timers.

	MRecipientFilter::(TeamToEnum, AddByFilter)
	CStringLib::(H2toInt, Hex2Int, Str2Sig, StrToHexStr, StrNew, StrCopy)
	CMessageLib::(Menu) from accepting dynamic options in char*
	Plus the forgot ones

	Eventscripts scripts are now python based, so optional you can compile your plugin with python support.
	And make your plugin ES friendly
	Compile with python feature is dedicated to Eventscripts.
	Thanks for the great EventScripts and what I learned there
